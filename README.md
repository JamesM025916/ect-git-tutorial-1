# The purpose of this project is to gain a better understanding of how git hub works
# We will also be working through some basic setup instructions.

#After saving add more text to the file
#I've been using comments because it is unclear if this needs to be a program or random notes

# These next lines should be added from the online repository
# I noticed that there is a difference in bolding based on whether there is a space or not after the #.
